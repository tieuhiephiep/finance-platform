00:00:01.232 --> 00:00:07.893
So now that we've learned how HONO works, you can go ahead and leave the API route behind, right?


00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.074
So we're going to go back on the front end now.


00:00:10.674 --> 00:00:13.714
So if you made these authors and books, you can leave them.


00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.755
If you haven't made this, you didn't have to, right?


00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:21.916
So what I'm actually going to do is I'm just going to return this back to hello.


00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:29.297
And I'm going to go ahead and simply get the context and return c.json hello world.


00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:38.306
So just the most basic API route here, and I'm going to remove the authors and the books.


00:00:40.048 --> 00:00:42.570
And I will also remove the respective imports for that.


00:00:42.947 --> 00:00:43.287
There we go.


00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:45.848
So just the simplest implementation possible.


00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.950
And you can leave that behind for now.


00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.430
We're going to come back to this later.


00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.772
For now, let's go inside of the app.


00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.373
Let's go inside of the dashboard.


00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:58.835
So one more thing that the route groups are good for is that they can share layouts.


00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:08.661
So what we can do now is for every future route that is going to exist inside of the dashboard route group is going to share a unique layout.


00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.402
So let's go ahead and create not a unique layout.


00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:14.523
I wanted to say it's going to share a common layout.


00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:16.944
So layout.tsx.


00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:19.325
As you can see, we immediately get an error here.


00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.927
So the rules of layouts are similar to the rules of page.


00:01:23.127 --> 00:01:24.968
It needs to have a default export.


00:01:25.188 --> 00:01:27.369
So I'm going to call this dashboard layout.


00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:31.051
The naming does not matter because this is a default export.


00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.994
So just make sure you export something and let's for now return a div and say layout.


00:01:40.123 --> 00:01:41.203
So what's going on now?


00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:45.528
Why am I only getting the text layout rendered here?


00:01:45.587 --> 00:01:46.929
Let me zoom in so you can see.


00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:52.535
So it only says layout, but what I expect is that my user button is rendered, right?


00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:56.959
Or we can call this dashboard page.


00:01:59.113 --> 00:02:01.416
So how do I get that rendered here?


00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:05.941
Well, another rule of layout is that it needs to render the children.


00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:12.468
So let's quickly create the props, children to be a type of react.reactNode.


00:02:13.288 --> 00:02:16.773
And then in here, we are able to destructure those props.


00:02:17.964 --> 00:02:30.113
Children and instead of this we just render the children and there we go So now through this layout we render the dashboard page and every additional route 


00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:41.802
inside is gonna share this layout So whatever we create on top of here is gonna be reused so how about we go ahead and change this from being wrapped in 


00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:46.805
a big fragment and Instead of using div here, let's use main.


00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:51.667
And let's give it a class name of px3.


00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:55.988
And on large devices, it's going to be px14.


00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:01.070
And then what I want to do here is I want to create a header component.


00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:07.813
So let's go ahead inside of our components and let's create header.dsx.


00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:11.174
So inside of here, I'm going to export class header.


00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.403
And I'm going to return a div saying HeaderComponent.


00:03:19.185 --> 00:03:25.088
Now I can go back inside of App, Layout, and I can import Header from Component's Header.


00:03:25.407 --> 00:03:26.149
And there we go.


00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:33.093
So now all of my routes inside of Dashboard are going to have the HeaderComponent above them.


00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:33.754
Perfect.


00:03:34.474 --> 00:03:36.315
So we are now ready to start styling this.


00:03:37.035 --> 00:03:41.878
Instead of a div, we're going to use the header element, and let's give it a slight gradient.


00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:46.260
So background, gradient to bottom.


00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:57.346
So you can always hover over a class name to see if it actually exists in Tailwind, but that will only work if you have the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension 


00:03:57.426 --> 00:03:58.787
that I told you to install, I believe.


00:04:00.088 --> 00:04:01.809
So let's define from what color.


00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:20.250
So from blue, 700. blue 500 there we go so a slight gradient as you can see perfect let's give it a PX of 4 and a PY of 8 and I also want to define different 


00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:31.880
values for large devices so 14 and padding bottom of 36 there we go And now let's go ahead and let's just style this further.


00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.944
So I'm actually going to zoom out because I want to be looking at this as if it were a desktop view.


00:04:39.824 --> 00:04:41.625
So I recommend you do the same.


00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:53.471
So either expand your screen or zoom out until, well, just keep it, you know, a bit larger because when we go ahead and create our navigation,


00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:57.153
we're going to have separate navigation for mobile and separate for desktop, right?


00:04:57.892 --> 00:05:00.837
So, let's go ahead and create a div here with a class name.


00:05:01.938 --> 00:05:03.380
Max with screen.


00:05:04.947 --> 00:05:07.468
Excel and MX of auto.


00:05:08.148 --> 00:05:09.888
So what does this do?


00:05:10.048 --> 00:05:20.951
So if I create a text header here, you can see that at one point So let me just see at what on what at one point my header stops expanding,


00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:21.731
right?


00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:25.492
So that's what this does max with screen.


00:05:25.812 --> 00:05:32.615
So we are only going to handle the responsivity after a certain With of the monitor, right?


00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:42.142
So I don't want to support responsivity if the monitor is wider than this We're simply gonna push everything in the middle if it breaks From this right 


00:05:42.162 --> 00:05:47.165
you can see how header is expanding expanding expanding and now it stops expanding.


00:05:47.325 --> 00:05:52.109
So that's what this does Great now inside of here.


00:05:52.349 --> 00:06:08.173
Let's open up a new div with a class name and of full width flex item center justify between and a margin bottom of 14 and then in here another div which 


00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:19.080
is going to hold two elements together so for that i'm going to need flex again and i'm just going to give them a bigger gap between if we are on desktop 


00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:34.404
and now let's create a header logo component so inside of components let's create a header logo.dsx and inside of here i'm going to import link from next 


00:06:35.384 --> 00:06:48.229
link and i'm going to import image from next image and i'm going to export const header logo this is going to be a link with an href to the root page and 


00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:59.452
i div which for now can just say logo Let's go back inside of header and we can now import the header logo from dot slash header logo or components logo,


00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:01.154
however you prefer it.


00:07:02.774 --> 00:07:06.975
And now you should just have a link which says logo at the top.


00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:14.998
Let's go ahead and give it an image which we already used inside of our sign in and sign up components, logo.svg.


00:07:15.798 --> 00:07:18.539
So inside of here, let's give this div a class name.


00:07:19.918 --> 00:07:30.341
items center is going to be hidden by default right so that's why i told you to try and expand your browser because i want this to be visible on large 


00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:40.865
devices so hidden on mobile but when we hit the large breakpoint we give it flex like that and then inside of here let's render our image component with 


00:07:40.945 --> 00:07:54.914
a source of slash logo dot svg and out of logo and let's give it a height of 28 and width of 28. Below the image, let's give it a paragraph,


00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:58.558
finance, so that can be the name of your app, right?


00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:01.060
You can write here whatever you want.


00:08:02.168 --> 00:08:13.299
So I'm going to give this a font-semi-bold, text-white, text to Excel, and ml of 2.5. So if I expand this, there we go.


00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.002
We now have a nice logo.


00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:19.525
And whenever we click on this, it's going to redirect us to the root page.


00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:22.508
So right now, it has no effect because we are on the root page.


00:08:23.109 --> 00:08:23.449
Perfect.


00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:26.593
So we have our finance and it disappears on mobile.


00:08:26.613 --> 00:08:31.598
So we want that because as I told you, we're going to have a bit of a separate design on mobile.


00:08:32.338 --> 00:08:32.679
Perfect.


00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:34.821
So that's it for our header logo.


00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:39.866
So we can close everything here and let's get back inside of our header.


00:08:40.146 --> 00:08:43.009
So I said that two elements are going to be inside.


00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:45.511
The second element is the navigation element.


00:08:46.152 --> 00:08:48.633
So let's go ahead and create that inside of components.


00:08:48.673 --> 00:08:57.395
Let's create navigation, but at the SX right here, and I'm immediately going to mark this as use client because I'm going to be using some hooks here,


00:08:57.635 --> 00:09:00.096
not immediately, but definitely in a moment.


00:09:00.956 --> 00:09:03.577
And let's go ahead and just fix the import error here.


00:09:03.597 --> 00:09:07.857
So navigation and let's return native navigation.


00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:19.974
and I don't need a semicolon here and I can now import navigation from dot slash navigation or components navigation.


00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:21.395
Great.


00:09:21.715 --> 00:09:26.599
Now, instead of the navigation here, let's go ahead and let's define all of the routes that we are going to have.


00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.523
So I'm going to write export const, actually no need to export it, so we can just use routes.


00:09:31.803 --> 00:09:33.405
It's going to be an array of objects.


00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:41.410
First object is going to have an href of root page and a label of overview or dashboard, however you like it.


00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:43.232
Let's copy and paste this.


00:09:43.673 --> 00:09:46.655
And for the second one, we're going to have slash transactions.


00:09:48.096 --> 00:09:50.278
And that's going to lead us to transactions.


00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:53.691
Let's copy and paste this.


00:09:54.431 --> 00:09:55.712
Remember to add the columns.


00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:57.712
Sorry, the commas.


00:09:58.872 --> 00:10:00.011
Then we're going to have accounts.


00:10:06.914 --> 00:10:07.174
Whoops.


00:10:08.014 --> 00:10:09.554
Then we're going to have categories.


00:10:16.736 --> 00:10:19.276
And lastly, we're going to have the settings page.


00:10:21.677 --> 00:10:22.037
There we go.


00:10:23.462 --> 00:10:23.782
Perfect.


00:10:23.802 --> 00:10:24.881
So now we have that.


00:10:25.423 --> 00:10:31.524
And now I want to go ahead and I want to create a component called a nav button.


00:10:32.285 --> 00:10:38.567
So actually, before we do that, let's try and just iterate over this routes array so that we can work with that.


00:10:38.947 --> 00:10:40.127
So it's not going to be a div.


00:10:40.527 --> 00:10:40.787
Whoops.


00:10:41.687 --> 00:10:42.908
It's not going to be a div.


00:10:42.968 --> 00:10:46.089
It's going to be a nav element with a class name of hidden.


00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:51.308
on mobile, but flex or visible on large.


00:10:52.328 --> 00:10:54.671
And items are going to be centered.


00:10:55.052 --> 00:11:02.857
Gap between each of the element is going to be two and overflow XAuto in case we need to scroll.


00:11:03.739 --> 00:11:05.140
And now we're going to go over the routes.


00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.641
So routes.map.


00:11:07.722 --> 00:11:09.283
We get the individual route.


00:11:10.184 --> 00:11:13.707
And for now we can just write route.label.


00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:16.918
you can ignore the error for now.


00:11:16.938 --> 00:11:20.280
So expand your screen and you should be able to see on desktop mode.


00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:27.206
So expand that much that you can see the logo and then you should finally be able to see overview, transactions, accounts,


00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:28.587
categories and the settings.


00:11:29.047 --> 00:11:38.594
So now what we're going to do is instead of rendering them as a paragraph, we're going to reuse this href and label as props for a component called nav button.


00:11:39.034 --> 00:11:42.416
So remove the paragraph and create a nav button here.


00:11:42.817 --> 00:11:44.077
So it doesn't yet exist.


00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:49.499
First of all, give it the key of route.hrf because that's unique for each of our routes.


00:11:50.199 --> 00:11:54.660
And then give it an actual href to be route.hrf.


00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:58.082
And label is going to be route.label.


00:11:59.182 --> 00:12:02.503
And now let's go ahead and let's add our hook.


00:12:02.783 --> 00:12:07.484
So that's why I marked this as useClient called usePathName.


00:12:08.024 --> 00:12:11.465
So inside of here, I'm going to get the path name from usePathName.


00:12:12.646 --> 00:12:13.026
Like that.


00:12:13.893 --> 00:12:16.227
And I'm going to go ahead and call this is active.


00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:20.943
if path name is identical to route.hrap.


00:12:21.223 --> 00:12:26.966
So if you're confused about the use client connection with the hooks, I'm going to go back in a moment and explain this,


00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:29.367
but let's just resolve this error here.


00:12:30.107 --> 00:12:35.670
So instead of components folder, I'm going to create a nav-button.dsx file right here.


00:12:36.471 --> 00:12:39.993
And instead of here, well, let's just quickly export const nav button.


00:12:40.513 --> 00:12:42.894
So we don't have to have that error.


00:12:42.934 --> 00:12:44.215
So div nav button.


00:12:45.445 --> 00:12:47.867
And right now we're going to have prop errors.


00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:50.808
So how about we also wrap up defining the props?


00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:52.469
So type props in here.


00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.831
Let's give it an href of string.


00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:56.972
Let's give it a label of string.


00:12:58.032 --> 00:13:02.175
Is active of boolean.


00:13:05.442 --> 00:13:08.904
And let's go ahead and assign those props here.


00:13:08.924 --> 00:13:10.344
So props, there we go.


00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:12.045
So that should work fine.


00:13:13.046 --> 00:13:18.949
Let's go back inside of the navigation and let's import this to dot slash nav button or components nav button.


00:13:19.109 --> 00:13:21.270
I like to separate this from the global imports.


00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.590
There we go.


00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:25.492
So let's go ahead and try something.


00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:29.335
If I remove use client, there we go, I get an error here.


00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:30.155
What does it say?


00:13:30.355 --> 00:13:34.158
It says you're importing a component that needs use path name.


00:13:34.718 --> 00:13:40.122
It only works in a client component, but none of its parents are marked with use client.


00:13:40.482 --> 00:13:44.424
So they are server components by default, right?


00:13:44.464 --> 00:13:51.208
So if you want to learn more about that, you can follow the documentation on this error here where you will learn the fundamentals,


00:13:51.249 --> 00:13:51.409
right?


00:13:51.828 --> 00:13:58.311
So server components allow us to write UI and it can be rendered and optionally cached on the server.


00:13:58.651 --> 00:14:04.273
In Next.js, the rendering work is further split by route segments to enable streaming and blah, blah, blah.


00:14:04.293 --> 00:14:05.633
So you can read all about that.


00:14:06.193 --> 00:14:13.475
So what's important for you to understand if you're coming from a background which is not Next.js, meaning that if you're used to,


00:14:13.495 --> 00:14:19.677
you know, React and invite, React and Webpack, So that is a form of building single-page applications.


00:14:19.777 --> 00:14:25.800
What we're doing here is we are building applications with server components, right?


00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.322
So server components can be used, as we just read, to write UI.


00:14:30.862 --> 00:14:35.884
And, well, one cool thing about them is that you can directly fetch from the database inside of them.


00:14:35.904 --> 00:14:40.026
So you can imagine them as your get API route, if you want to.


00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:51.913
one thing that they cannot do is work in with interactivity and that also includes hooks so whenever you need a hook in a component you will mark that 


00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:57.254
as use client All right, when I save this, the error goes away.


00:14:57.474 --> 00:15:00.514
But let me just comment it out for a second just to discuss this.


00:15:00.994 --> 00:15:06.836
So why did they then say none of its parents are marked with use client?


00:15:06.996 --> 00:15:08.056
What does that mean?


00:15:08.556 --> 00:15:16.278
So if you want to, use client shouldn't exactly be explained as, all right, make this component interactive.


00:15:16.798 --> 00:15:19.519
Use client is more of a boundary.


00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:24.300
You open the client-server boundary at this point.


00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.521
So if you want to, you don't have to do it at the navigation level.


00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:32.902
You can do it, for example, in the parent, in the header level.


00:15:33.222 --> 00:15:35.823
So header is the one that renders the navigation.


00:15:35.883 --> 00:15:48.287
So if I were to mark the entire header as use client, That means that the boundary of client server has been opened and that allows me to use the hook 


00:15:48.307 --> 00:15:52.989
inside of navigation component without marking it specifically as use client.


00:15:53.229 --> 00:15:54.830
So I just wanted to quickly explain that.


00:15:55.310 --> 00:16:02.912
So now you might be thinking, all right, so if I ever mark something as use client, that means that nothing inside can ever be a server component.


00:16:03.252 --> 00:16:07.212
Well, it seems like that, but there is a trick to do that as well.


00:16:07.352 --> 00:16:15.074
You can insert a client component inside a server component inside of a client component.


00:16:15.114 --> 00:16:17.714
And we actually are going to do that in this tutorial.


00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:20.055
And you do that by using children.


00:16:20.515 --> 00:16:21.015
like this.


00:16:21.035 --> 00:16:26.637
So if you pass server components through children, then you can safely mark something as use client.


00:16:27.218 --> 00:16:31.199
All right, we're going to come to that example at some point and I'm going to explain it again.


00:16:31.739 --> 00:16:34.020
Now let's stop the confusion and let's do the following.


00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.381
In the header, we don't need use client.


00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:41.125
So if possible, try and make the most of your routes server-side rendered.


00:16:41.605 --> 00:16:44.507
My apologies, not server-side rendered, but server components.


00:16:44.928 --> 00:16:48.290
So yes, server components and server-side rendering is not the same thing.


00:16:48.771 --> 00:16:53.514
If you mark something as use client, that is still server-side rendered.


00:16:54.175 --> 00:16:56.116
It's just not a server component.


00:16:56.617 --> 00:16:58.718
So that's a big misconception that people have.


00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:03.842
Marking something as use client still means that it's going to be rendered on the server.


00:17:04.002 --> 00:17:05.784
It's just not a server component.


00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:13.284
Nevertheless, we need useClient inside of our navigation component because we want to access the usePathName hook.


00:17:14.205 --> 00:17:17.287
And we're going to use it to check whether our route is active or not.


00:17:17.507 --> 00:17:22.150
Now let's go inside of the nav button here and let's go ahead and give it some cool, cool styles.


00:17:22.811 --> 00:17:27.454
So first of all, let's destructure the href, the label and the isActive prop.


00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:36.027
And let's go ahead and let me see if I have inside of my UI, we already have the button component perfect.


00:17:36.547 --> 00:17:38.308
So let's render that button component.


00:17:39.928 --> 00:17:42.968
So from dot slash UI button or components UI button.


00:17:44.609 --> 00:17:48.549
And inside of here, we're going to add a link component from next link.


00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:51.090
We're going to give it an href of href.


00:17:51.609 --> 00:17:54.170
And inside of link, we are going to render the label.


00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.391
The link was imported from next slash link like this.


00:17:58.442 --> 00:18:05.571
Great, now let's go ahead and give this first of all as a child prop and then let's give it a size of small.


00:18:06.292 --> 00:18:08.955
Let's give it a variant of outline.


00:18:10.223 --> 00:18:21.606
and now let's give it a class name but not just any class name we are going to revisit in our lib utils this cn method which i told you was going to be 


00:18:21.646 --> 00:18:33.625
used whenever we need to dynamically change tailwind classes so technically we could be doing this we could open uh we could do this like is active then something,


00:18:33.965 --> 00:18:35.205
otherwise something.


00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:36.566
We could do that.


00:18:37.086 --> 00:18:46.328
But you're going to notice that very soon when working with different variants and dynamic classes, there's a lot of things that can go wrong.


00:18:46.528 --> 00:18:55.231
Especially that one thing people don't consider is that Tailwind has a just-in-time compiler, which means that you need to write classes in full.


00:18:55.731 --> 00:18:59.872
So a lot of people try to do some weird tricks with these ternaries and stuff.


00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:11.378
what works best is truly having this combination clsx and tailwind merge so we're going to use that so here's how that function works import cn from libutils 


00:19:11.518 --> 00:19:22.905
as i just did and open up this function in the first argument it's going to take all the default classes and then every additional argument can be a ternary 


00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:27.284
for example is active It can be something, otherwise this.


00:19:27.984 --> 00:19:28.184
Right.


00:19:28.465 --> 00:19:29.746
So that's how we're going to do that.


00:19:29.986 --> 00:19:34.009
So let's focus on the first argument here and let's define how we want our button to look.


00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.971
I want to give it a full width.


00:19:36.752 --> 00:19:39.314
On large, I want to give it an auto width.


00:19:40.215 --> 00:19:41.836
I want to give it a justify between.


00:19:41.856 --> 00:19:44.178
I want to give it a font normal.


00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:51.825
On hover, I want to give it a background white slash 20, meaning it's going to have an opacity.


00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.992
On hover, I also want to give it a text white.


00:19:57.153 --> 00:19:59.854
I want to remove any kind of border on the button.


00:20:00.815 --> 00:20:08.980
On focus visible, I want to remove the ring by using ring offset and setting it to zero.


00:20:10.041 --> 00:20:17.006
Again, on focus visible, I want to remove the ring by setting its color to transparent.


00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.229
I want to also remove the outline of the button.


00:20:22.406 --> 00:20:24.787
I wanna make the text white by default.


00:20:26.247 --> 00:20:36.169
On focus, I wanna change the background to be white slash 30. And I wanna make all of that a bit animated using the transition class.


00:20:36.949 --> 00:20:46.472
And now, if the element is active, I'm gonna give it a background white with opacity of 10. Otherwise, background is gonna be transparent.


00:20:48.892 --> 00:20:51.433
And besides this, let's also give it a text white.


00:20:52.512 --> 00:21:02.481
there we go let's try this out now perfect so now we can see how since this is an active route because we are on the root page it has a different style 


00:21:02.541 --> 00:21:10.308
as opposed to all the other ones and you can see how hover has its own style if you try and click on any of those you're going to get a 404 because we 


00:21:10.368 --> 00:21:14.609
didn't build any of those now What's missing now is the mobile view, right?


00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.330
So you can clearly see that here.


00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:22.432
So for that, we are going to need to have a separate component, uh, called a sheet.


00:21:22.652 --> 00:21:24.693
So let's go ahead inside of our.


00:21:25.353 --> 00:21:26.093
Terminal here.


00:21:26.113 --> 00:21:37.217
Yeah, let's do bun, uh, bun X shad CN UI latest ad sheet like this.


00:21:40.334 --> 00:21:43.997
And let's go ahead and import everything we need from that.


00:21:45.578 --> 00:21:48.820
And let me just not forget to run my app.


00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:51.202
So bun run dev.


00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:52.282
There we go.


00:21:52.303 --> 00:21:58.888
So inside of here, let's import everything we need from components UI.


00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:00.569
There we go.


00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:08.475
We are going to need the sheet itself, the content and the trigger.


00:22:10.819 --> 00:22:11.179
like that.


00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:19.523
And then I actually want to install one more package, which we're going to use a couple of times throughout the project.


00:22:19.583 --> 00:22:22.904
So bun add is going to be called the react use.


00:22:23.244 --> 00:22:24.744
Quick reminder, I'm using bun.


00:22:24.945 --> 00:22:31.848
If you're using node, you should write npm install or yarn add or pnpm, whatever it is.


00:22:32.068 --> 00:22:32.228
Right.


00:22:33.349 --> 00:22:33.648
All right.


00:22:33.729 --> 00:22:36.430
So make sure you add a react use package.


00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:48.845
And then in here, Let's from React use import use media like this.


00:22:51.073 --> 00:22:54.975
And I'm doing this in a wrong component, my apologies.


00:22:55.315 --> 00:22:56.876
So I'm doing this in nav button.


00:22:57.416 --> 00:22:59.838
Where I meant to do this was in the navigation component.


00:22:59.998 --> 00:23:04.781
So go back inside of the navigation component and add the sheet components here.


00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:06.662
So I'm going to remove them from the nav button.


00:23:07.022 --> 00:23:09.303
And same is true for this ReactUseImport.


00:23:09.583 --> 00:23:12.365
So not in the nav button, in the navigation.


00:23:14.315 --> 00:23:15.475
Whoops, there we go.


00:23:16.356 --> 00:23:16.696
Perfect.


00:23:17.416 --> 00:23:21.018
So now that we have that, we're going to go ahead and do the following.


00:23:22.178 --> 00:23:28.780
Let's go ahead and define whether our drawer is going to be opened or not.


00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:34.483
So it's open and set is open, use state from react by default, false.


00:23:34.963 --> 00:23:38.164
So just make sure you add the use state import here.


00:23:40.196 --> 00:23:46.019
And then what I want to do is I want to go ahead and add the router from useRouter.


00:23:46.879 --> 00:23:49.159
So that's going to come from NextNavigation.


00:23:49.239 --> 00:23:53.621
Make sure you don't accidentally import the useRouter from Next slash router.


00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:55.601
So NextNavigation.


00:23:57.001 --> 00:23:57.402
All right.


00:23:58.002 --> 00:24:04.686
And let's define isMobile to be useMedia if Open up parentheses.


00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:08.507
MaxWidth is 1024 pixels.


00:24:09.007 --> 00:24:15.369
And important for hydration, by default, let's assume that the view is not mobile.


00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:21.853
And then let's add onClick here to accept an href, which is a string.


00:24:23.113 --> 00:24:26.994
Router.push href.


00:24:27.715 --> 00:24:30.016
And set is open is going to be false.


00:24:31.664 --> 00:24:34.345
You're going to see why we need this in a moment.


00:24:34.465 --> 00:24:39.907
And that's because if we are on mobile, we're going to have a completely separate return happening here.


00:24:39.928 --> 00:24:45.911
So we're going to use our sheet component here, and we're going to control it using the isOpen boolean.


00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:49.571
And onOpenChange is going to call the setIsOpen.


00:24:50.173 --> 00:24:51.453
So just like this.


00:24:53.054 --> 00:24:56.035
Oh, inside of here, we need a trigger component.


00:24:56.916 --> 00:24:58.557
And for that, we're going to use a button.


00:24:58.757 --> 00:25:00.277
So make sure you import the button.


00:25:00.377 --> 00:25:04.869
I'm going to change the to go to components like this.


00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:08.773
So, components UI button.


00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:09.394
There we go.


00:25:10.155 --> 00:25:11.517
And let's go ahead and do the following.


00:25:11.577 --> 00:25:13.519
Let's give it a variant of outline.


00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:15.601
Let's give it a size of small.


00:25:16.121 --> 00:25:18.404
Let's give it a class name of font normal.


00:25:19.144 --> 00:25:21.987
Background white slash 10 on hover.


00:25:22.186 --> 00:25:26.392
Background white slash 20. Hover is going to have text white.


00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:45.529
border is not going to exist and we can just copy from our nav button the focus visible ones so those two focus visible ring offset zero and ring transparent 


00:25:45.569 --> 00:25:58.391
those two outline is going to be none text is going to be white focus vgy slash 30 and transition Like that.


00:25:58.952 --> 00:26:01.916
And I think we also need border none.


00:26:02.698 --> 00:26:03.439
There we go.


00:26:03.499 --> 00:26:04.220
We already have it.


00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:04.601
Great.


00:26:05.871 --> 00:26:18.321
so font normal bgy 10 on hover bgy 20 on hover we're gonna have text white border none the reused focus visible with ring offset zero and ring transparent 


00:26:18.401 --> 00:26:30.090
outline none text white and on focus background white slash 30 and transition great and inside we're gonna use a menu icon from lucid react so make sure 


00:26:30.191 --> 00:26:32.393
you've added this There we go.


00:26:33.694 --> 00:26:44.782
And let's go ahead and give this a class name of 84 and width 4. One cool thing in the new tailwind update is that this class name can now be replaced 


00:26:44.863 --> 00:26:49.147
with size 4. So that's the equivalent, right, if you want to.


00:26:49.946 --> 00:26:54.051
Great, so now we have a trigger, but now we need a content here.


00:26:55.013 --> 00:27:07.898
like this so inside of here let's go ahead and give it a side of left and let's give it a class name of px2 and let's open up our small navigation here 


00:27:07.939 --> 00:27:19.523
with a class name of flex flex column gap y of 2 and padding top of 6 so it gives a little space to the top because of the close button and now inside 


00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:31.270
of here let's go over our routes.map let's get the individual route And we are simply going to render a button component here like that.


00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:34.311
So I'm going to give this a variant.


00:27:35.412 --> 00:27:38.094
If route.href is equal to path name.


00:27:38.114 --> 00:27:41.016
In that case, it's going to be secondary.


00:27:41.455 --> 00:27:42.797
Otherwise it's going to be ghost.


00:27:46.599 --> 00:27:51.182
And let's go ahead and give it this a key route.href.


00:27:56.201 --> 00:28:03.843
and let's give it an onClick to be an arrow function which calls the onClick method and route.href like that.


00:28:04.243 --> 00:28:08.284
So why are we using onClick here instead of adding a link?


00:28:08.924 --> 00:28:13.365
Because link by itself will not close the drawer, right?


00:28:14.005 --> 00:28:23.627
So I want to handle the mobile view by going through our onClick method which will use the router hook to redirect and manually close the drawer.


00:28:24.798 --> 00:28:25.338
There we go.


00:28:25.518 --> 00:28:28.079
And inside of here, we just render route dot label.


00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:31.240
And I believe that should be it.


00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.901
So if I refresh my page, make sure you have your local host running here.


00:28:36.661 --> 00:28:39.222
So let's see if we did something wrong.


00:28:39.242 --> 00:28:42.543
So this seems to work, but nothing is appearing here.


00:28:42.963 --> 00:28:43.463
Let's see.


00:28:44.463 --> 00:28:46.484
Why is that happening right here?


00:28:47.184 --> 00:28:49.204
So I have max with 1024 pixels.


00:28:49.244 --> 00:28:51.945
I'm going to go ahead and console log.


00:28:53.846 --> 00:28:57.087
is mobile here and try and debug.


00:29:00.747 --> 00:29:03.408
Oh, looks like I just had to do a hard refresh.


00:29:05.268 --> 00:29:06.988
Yes, looks like it was just cache.


00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:09.769
So nothing I did fixed it.


00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:10.169
Okay.


00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:18.290
So if you want to, you can, if you have the same reason, let's go ahead and just do bun run dev together.


00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:20.471
It looks like it was some weird cache inside.


00:29:21.431 --> 00:29:23.972
So now, again, desktop works fine.


00:29:24.572 --> 00:29:28.732
But on mobile, now I have a drawer like this.


00:29:29.393 --> 00:29:29.913
Perfect.


00:29:30.893 --> 00:29:39.895
One thing that I might want to change is I want to move the text to be here in the beginning.


00:29:40.375 --> 00:29:46.956
So how about I go inside of my isMobile and how about I add a class name here.


00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.462
Pull width and justify start.


00:29:52.303 --> 00:29:52.963
There we go.


00:29:53.604 --> 00:29:56.266
So that now looks better in my opinion.


00:29:56.386 --> 00:29:58.468
So when I click overview, there we go.


00:29:58.488 --> 00:30:04.393
You can see how it closes the drawer and it's going to do that even in this 404 routes.


00:30:04.994 --> 00:30:05.454
Perfect.


00:30:05.474 --> 00:30:09.318
So that handles our navigation component right here.


00:30:10.138 --> 00:30:13.661
What we have to build now is the welcome message right here.


00:30:13.902 --> 00:30:16.224
And below that, we're going to have some filters.


00:30:17.972 --> 00:30:21.415
So before we wrap up the chapter, I want to do that.


00:30:21.455 --> 00:30:26.440
I want to add a little logout button here and a welcome message here.


00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.863
And we're going to leave the filters for later.


00:30:29.603 --> 00:30:35.749
So let's go ahead and go inside of our components navigation right here.


00:30:35.769 --> 00:30:39.072
It's not navigation header.


00:30:39.893 --> 00:30:50.268
so we have header logo and we have navigation and now what i want to do is outside of this div i want to add a user button component And I want to give 


00:30:50.288 --> 00:30:53.529
it an after sign out URL to go slash to the root page.


00:30:53.689 --> 00:30:56.630
So from clerk next JS import the user button.


00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:03.151
Uh, here's one thing that I don't like when I refresh, it doesn't exist for a second.


00:31:03.331 --> 00:31:07.652
So we can solve that by using the clerk loading and Clark loaded components.


00:31:08.272 --> 00:31:10.953
So Clark loading and Clark loaded.


00:31:10.973 --> 00:31:16.674
If it is loaded, we're going to display this.


00:31:19.491 --> 00:31:26.553
But if it is not, if it's still loading, in that case, let's add a loader to from Lucid react.


00:31:29.114 --> 00:31:37.957
And let's give it a class name, size eight, animate spin and text slate or hundred.


00:31:38.737 --> 00:31:39.698
So let's try it out now.


00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.620
When I refresh, there we go.


00:31:42.781 --> 00:31:46.061
We have a nice little spinner and from here we can sign out.


00:31:46.401 --> 00:31:46.721
Perfect.


00:31:47.482 --> 00:31:49.982
Now let's go ahead and let's create a welcome message.


00:31:50.662 --> 00:32:00.385
So, outside of this div right here, let's add a welcome MSG like this.


00:32:01.733 --> 00:32:04.235
So I'm going to go ahead and create a new component.


00:32:04.375 --> 00:32:07.718
Welcome msg.tsx.


00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:17.326
And let's use client here because we are going to need to use a hook called use user from clerk next.js.


00:32:18.146 --> 00:32:20.408
Let's export const welcome message.


00:32:21.969 --> 00:32:27.334
And let's destructure the user and is loaded from use user right here.


00:32:28.955 --> 00:32:31.077
Let's return a div element.


00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:42.501
And inside of here, we're going to have an H2 element, which will say, welcome back below that a paragraph.


00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:52.523
This is your financial overview report or whatever message you prefer.


00:32:53.523 --> 00:32:58.265
So go back inside of the header and import the dot slash welcome message.


00:32:58.745 --> 00:32:59.905
I'm going to use the components.


00:33:00.447 --> 00:33:00.967
And there we go.


00:33:00.987 --> 00:33:03.268
We now have the welcome message here.


00:33:03.908 --> 00:33:09.310
So I'm going to go ahead and give this div a class name of space Y2 and margin bottom of four.


00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:15.272
I'm going to give the H2 element a class name of text to Excel on large.


00:33:15.372 --> 00:33:17.213
It's going to be text for Excel.


00:33:18.253 --> 00:33:19.673
Text is going to be white.


00:33:19.693 --> 00:33:22.774
Point is going to be medium.


00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:24.175
Flex.


00:33:25.935 --> 00:33:27.056
Actually, no need for that.


00:33:28.109 --> 00:33:44.614
right and for the paragraph we're gonna give it a class name of text small lg text base and text is gonna go ahead and be a specific color 89b6fd like 


00:33:46.554 --> 00:33:56.240
this there we go so this looks nice What I want to do now is I want the welcome back message to Write out the user's name.


00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.921
So how about we do this?


00:33:58.081 --> 00:34:09.324
Let's go ahead and At the end of this welcome back open an object and write if is loaded I well, I told you to open an object what I meant to say was open 


00:34:09.364 --> 00:34:09.925
curly brackets, right?


00:34:10.705 --> 00:34:27.228
So if it's loaded Add a comma and the space otherwise just space so it's important that you add space here and then chain along user question mark first 


00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:39.608
name and then if you want to you can add additional space and you can add a little emoji like i'm gonna do like this like a wave And there we go.


00:34:39.628 --> 00:34:41.068
So this will read the name.


00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:44.811
I have this weird name from my Gmail because I didn't want to enter my name.


00:34:45.271 --> 00:34:49.233
So this will load the name from your Google account.


00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:54.936
If you used email login, perhaps your first name won't exist.


00:34:55.036 --> 00:35:00.139
So if you want to, you know, you can just say welcome back with a smile like this.


00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:02.561
You can just do this as well, however you want.


00:35:03.985 --> 00:35:04.265
Great.


00:35:04.325 --> 00:35:09.969
So that wraps up our header component, our navigation.


00:35:10.089 --> 00:35:10.550
Perfect.


00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:17.154
So what's going to be below this are two filters, the account filter and the date filter, right?


00:35:17.554 --> 00:35:20.737
But I kind of want to work on them later, right?


00:35:21.297 --> 00:35:32.593
What I want to build next is I want to start actually working on setting up our database and setting up our schema so that we can create our first transaction,


00:35:33.013 --> 00:35:33.194
right?


00:35:33.334 --> 00:35:34.676
That's what I want to do next.


00:35:35.937 --> 00:35:36.939
Great, great job.
